# Lightweight dependencies for running API unit tests in CI.
# Use this file instead of requirements.txt to avoid heavy installs (torch, transformers, pymilvus, etc.).
#
# Install:
#   pip install -r api/requirements-test.txt
#
# Notes:
# - Focuses on Flask app tests and pure-Python parsing utilities.
# - If a specific test requires an extra lib, add it here with a pinned version.

# Web framework (used by the Flask test client in unit tests)
Flask==3.0.3

# Testing
pytest==8.2.0
pytest-mock==3.14.0

# Validation (kept light; used by schema/validation related tests if present)
marshmallow==3.21.3
