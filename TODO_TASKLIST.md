## Phase 4 — SOTA Parsing Engine (Planning Only — No Implementation Yet)

*Scope:* Planning acknowledgment of the canonical SOTA Parsing Engine brain (`Brains 🧠/parsing_engine_sota_prompt.md`) and decomposition of future work into atomic, gated tasks. No dataset building, semantic linking, Milvus ingestion, or event JSON parsing logic is to be implemented in this phase. Only documentation alignment, flags, test placeholders, and branch/worktree isolation planning.

### Epic S1: SOTA Parsing Engine Bootstrap (Planning)

- [x] S1-01: Add dedicated checklist file `Brains 🧠/sota_checklist.md` enumerating all acceptance criteria from the SOTA brain prompt (source-of-truth sync).
- [x] S1-02: Create isolated branch `feature/sota-parsing-engine-bootstrap` and add Git worktree (`git worktree add ../Project_Dhruv_sota feature/sota-parsing-engine-bootstrap`) (completed: branch created, pushed to GitHub, branch protection rules set for main requiring all Ironclad CI gates: lint-type, unit-tests, coverage-gate, security, licenses-sbom, web-a11y-perf, api-contract, perf-k6, e2e-smoke; strict mode enabled, 1 approving review required).
- [x] S1-03: Add placeholder failing test `tests/sota/parsing-brain-link.test.ts` verifying existence + hash of `parsing_engine_sota_prompt.md`.
- [x] S1-04: Feature flag placeholders added (config/flags.ts) for `ENABLE_SOTA_DATASET_BUILDER`, `ENABLE_SOTA_POST_PARSER` (default off).
- [x] S1-05: Draft minimal OpenAPI stub (no handlers) for future endpoints: `/api/sota/parse`, `/api/sota/datasets` (gated by flags).
- [x] S1-06: Author observability plan doc (`docs/sota_observability.md`) defining metrics: accuracy@1/@3, taxonomy_F1, date_accuracy, oov_rate, drift, RED (req_rate/errors/duration), Milvus query latency. (completed: 2025-09-10T12:00:00Z)
- [x] S1-07: Author rollback & canary strategy doc (`docs/sota_rollback_plan.md`) linking feature flags and ≤10 min rollback path. (completed: 2025-09-10T12:00:00Z)
- [x] S1-08: Add risk register entry (`docs/sota_risks.md`) covering data quality drift, ambiguous geo hierarchy, festival date resolution variance. (completed: 2025-09-10T12:00:00Z)
- [x] S1-09: Define data governance & lineage note (`docs/sota_lineage.md`) listing monthly ETL sources and checksum workflow (planned). (completed: 2025-09-10T12:00:00Z)
- [x] S1-10: Update runbook (`runbook.md`) with SOTA section pointer (no ops procedures yet). (completed: 2025-09-10T12:00:00Z)

### Phase 4 Notes
- Any attempt to implement parsing, embedding retrieval, deterministic/semantic linking, or JSON normalization before Phase 5 will violate scope lock.
- Completion Criterion for Phase 4: All planning artifacts + flags + placeholder tests merged (green CI) with zero runtime logic added.

---

## Phase 5 — Production Hardening (In Progress)

- [ ] **PH-01: High-volume ingestion (2,500+ tweets)**
  - [ ] Hourly batch fetch via existing script/cron (`--resume`), keeping `raw_tweets` schema (urls + engagement + processed_at) in sync across Neon + local worktrees.
  - [ ] Monitor rate limits + queue depth; page Ops if `npm run ops:commandview` reports `severity=alert` (exit code 1).
- [ ] **PH-02: Three-layer parsing at scale**
  - [ ] Run `scripts/parse_tweets_with_three_layer.js` with `PARSE_BATCH_LIMIT` batches, provisioning Gemini/Ollama quotas or pooling keys.
  - [ ] Add queue table / status updates so tweets move from `pending` → `parsed` → `failed` deterministically.
- [ ] **PH-03: Consensus → Review → Analytics handoff**
  - [ ] Keep Consensus voting (Gemini → Ollama → Regex) wired to `applyConsensusVoting`, ensuring failed tweets are re-queued.
  - [ ] Reviewers approve via `/review` UI → `/api/review/update` so `reviewed_by`, notes, and audit logs populate CommandView + analytics.
  - [ ] `/api/analytics` remains gated to `needs_review=false` and `review_status='approved'`.
- [ ] **PH-04: Local validation + screenshots**
  - [ ] `npm ci && npm run dev`, login via `/api/auth/login`, walk `/home`, `/review`, `/commandview`, `/analytics`.
  - [ ] Capture dashboard + export screenshots for `DASHBOARD_LIVE_SUMMARY.md`.
- [ ] **PH-05: CI/CD tightening**
  - [ ] Fix lint errors (DONE ✅) and keep suites green.
  - [ ] Re-enable coverage, API tests, CodeQL, web-perf, perf-k6, e2e smoke once local runs stabilize.
  - [ ] Push `analysis-main` once lint/tests are green (currently only local edits; nothing pushed).
- [ ] **PH-06: Production isolation + legacy archive**
  - [ ] Tag the release branch, freeze production-ready code.
  - [ ] Move experimental branches/worktrees + heavy archives into `archive/ga-legacy/`.
  - [ ] Update README/runbook with final architecture + deployment steps for client handoff.

### PR 38 — CI Checks Tracking (feat: SOTA Parsing Engine Bootstrap (Planning Phase))

- [ ] PR38-06: Add enhancement planning tasks (S1-11..S1-14) and docs tasks (DU-01..DU-06) to this TODO list.

### Docs To Author/Update (Local + GitHub)

### Appendix A — Understanding & Benefits (Summary)
- Automated Data Quality (Great Expectations/Pandera): shifts validation left with explicit data contracts; blocks bad data pre-ingest; produces living docs and stable analytics substrates.
- Knowledge Graph (Neo4j): formalizes rich relations for fast multi-hop queries that are cumbersome in SQL; leverages existing relations schema; unlocks advanced analytics.
- MLOps (MLflow/W&B): reproducible, auditable runs; drift-triggered retraining; model registry for safe promotion/rollback.
- Unified Query Layer (LlamaIndex/LangChain): NL to multi-store queries with routing to Postgres, Milvus, and Neo4j; lowers barrier for analysts; synthesizes coherent answers.
